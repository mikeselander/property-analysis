# Property Analysis Tool

This is a quick-and-dirty tool for evaluating the potential profit anf cashflow from a rental property deal. Enter a small amount of data, and it spits out a yes/no and numbers based on assumptions I've coded in. Far from production-ready, but good enough to know if a property is worth prusuing.

It was built using CRA and Material UI components for a quick form.
